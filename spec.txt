1. Initial Setup and Planning
Initialize the project using Laravel with Breeze and Inertia.js integration. Tailwind CSS will be the default styling tool.

Define core entities and relationships such as patients, appointments, encounters, files, billing codes, invoices, and users.

Plan user flows for each role: FrontDesk Clerk, Clinician, Biller, and Administrator.

2. Authentication & Roles
Set up user registration, login, and logout functionality.

Define user roles and permissions (FrontDesk Clerk, Clinician, Biller, Administrator).

Ensure role-based access to various parts of the system through middleware and route grouping.

3. Patient Registration Module
Create a form for registering new patients with fields for name, age, gender, contact info.

Include automatic ID generation and QR code creation for each patient.

Build a searchable listing of patients with filters by name or contact details.

4. Appointment Scheduler
Implement a calendar interface (day/week view) to display, book, reschedule, and cancel appointments.

Enable selecting a patient and clinician when booking.

Add visual indicators for appointment status (e.g., confirmed, cancelled).

Schedule reminders (e.g., email or SMS) before appointments.

5. EMR (Electronic Medical Record) / Encounter Module
Create a structured SOAP note interface with input fields for:

Subjective

Objective

Assessment

Plan

Include ENT-specific checkboxes or toggles (e.g., ear exam, nasal exam, throat exam).

Add the ability to upload and preview related images and videos from scopes or external devices.

Link each encounter to a patient and appointment for context.

6. Billing & Invoicing Module
Allow billers to select completed encounters and assign standardized billing codes (CPT and ICD).

Implement a lookup system to find and select appropriate codes.

Automatically calculate invoice amounts based on selected codes.

Generate a printable/downloadable invoice for each encounter.

Include a billing history for each patient.

7. Dashboards by Role
FrontDesk Clerk: Dashboard with todayâ€™s schedule, upcoming appointments, and quick patient registration access.

Clinician: View their appointments, start new encounters, and access patient EMRs.

Biller: View completed encounters needing billing, manage billing codes, and generate invoices.

Administrator: Manage user accounts, assign roles, view overall clinic reports and metrics.

8. Role-Based Navigation and Interface
Customize the navigation bar and layout depending on the user's role.

Ensure each role only sees relevant features and actions.

Provide visual feedback on tasks (e.g., success messages, error alerts).

9. File Handling and Storage
Store all uploaded files (images, videos) in a structured way linked to encounters.

Allow clinicians to preview or download files from the encounter interface.

Organize files by patient and date for easy retrieval.

10. Testing and Quality Assurance
Manually test each module and user flow across all roles.

Ensure validation is enforced on all forms.

Check for any access control loopholes.

Test mobile responsiveness and form usability.

11. Deployment and Configuration
Prepare for deployment on a production server (e.g., Forge + DigitalOcean).

Set up environment configuration, database, file storage, and queue workers (for reminders).

Ensure backups and secure storage of patient data.
